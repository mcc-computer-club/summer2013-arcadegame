This is a repo for the summer arcade game project for the MCC Maple Woods Computer Club.

Many details are yet to be determined. All we currently know is that we're wanting to  make a scrolling shooter game, at least from what we last discussed in club meetings before we closed out the Spring semester.

This means that we need to work on what sort of game environment we want to create. Do we want to have a WWII aircraft theme, or some futuristic space shooter? Perhaps something else altogether? Once we answer this question we can start to brainstorm what direction to take with creative assets and what features to implement.

Because we want to thank those that are giving up some of their time this Summer, we will list those that help out, including their particular role once that solidifies.
